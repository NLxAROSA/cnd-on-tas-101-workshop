## Cloud Native Development on PCF 201 - Workshop
This is the followup of the [Cloud Native Development on PCF 101 workshop](https://github.com/NLxAROSA/cnd-on-pcf-101-workshop) and will focus more in-depth on several topics of cloud native development. In this workshop you will develop several Spring Boot 2 micro services, deploy them to Cloud Foundry and learn how to setup several of the more advanced scenarios.

## Prerequisites

We expect you to bring:

* A laptop with Windows, Linux or MacOS
* A working internet connection
* An IDE or code editor of your choice

We expect you have installed:

* [JDK11 or higher](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://docs.run.pivotal.io/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html)

We expect you to have completed the [Cloud Native Development on PCF 101 workshop](https://github.com/NLxAROSA/cnd-on-pcf-101-workshop) and are familiar with the basics of PCF, Java and Spring Boot.

Login credentials and access to the environment will be provided by the instructor(s).


## Verify PCF CLI is working

```bash
cf -v
```

Login to Cloud Foundry:

```bash
cf login -a https://api.sys.lropcf.pushto.cf

## Build the project

For every exercise we need to build the project: 

```bash
mvn clean package
```

In case you don't have Maven installed run: 

```bash
./mvnw clean package
```


## Run the application locally

Before we push the application to Cloud Foundry run it locally first!

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Open in the browser: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
